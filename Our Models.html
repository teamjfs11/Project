            <h3>KOENIGSEGG REGERA</h3>
            <div class="paragraph"><p>The Regera was specifically designed to be a luxury megacar
                alternative to Koenigsegg’s traditional extreme, lightweight,
                race-like road-legal cars. It combines a powerful twin-turbo
                V8 combustion engine with three electric motors and
                cutting-edge battery power via new powertrain technology
                called the Koenigsegg Direct Drive.
                
                While traditional Koenigseggs have always had surprising
                levels of practicality, creature comforts and features, our
                primary focus has always been to make the fastest cars in the
                world. The Regera continues this tradition, but with
                innovative technology that blends outrageous speed,
                supreme comfort, and a unique Direct Drive experience.</p></div>

            <h3>KOENIGSEGG JESKO</h3>
            <div class="para"><p>Every surface element is constructed to reduce drag or
                surrounding turbulence while increasing high-speed stability.
                Just as powerful as its track-focused sibling, the Jesko
                Absolut is the more seamless and stealthier of the two.
                
                With a drag coefficient value of only 0.278 Cd in combination
                with a frontal area of 1.88 m² and a minimum power output of
                1600 bhp, the Jesko Absolut is destined to achieve higher,
                more extraordinary speeds than any Koenigsegg or any other
                fully homologated car before it. How fast? Time will tell.
                Looking at the math and our advanced simulations – it will be
                unbelievably fast.</p></div>

            <h3>KOENIGSEGG GEMERA</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Gemera combines the exciting performance
                    characteristics of a mid-engine two-seater megacar with the
                    practicalities of a full four-seater car with more luggage
                    space.
                    
                    This ground-breaking combination means that the
                    Koenigsegg megacar experience can now be shared with
                    family and friends.</p>

          <div class="para"><p>The CC850 is the ideal combination of classic design and
            cutting-edge technology, and is engineered to be the perfect
            driver’s car.
            
            Inspired by the original CC8S, the CC850 features the
            classic Koenigsegg silhouette, while the interior, and
            particularly the analog chronocluster, is a work of art.
            Meanwhile, every innovation under the hood is designed to
            enhance the driving experience, including the engage shift
            system (ESS) and light-speed transmission (LST).</p></div>
