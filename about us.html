    </u>

    <p> <big>
        Koenigsegg is a Swedish avante-garde megacar and
        innovative technology company. A record-breaking tradition
        courses through our history-the result of pushing the
        boundaries of automotive technology to achieve higher
        standards in ultimate performance. <br> <br>
        After the Chip Player and Click disappointments,
        and amidst the general boredom of running his
        import/export company, Christian decided that
        instead of chasing after the perfect business idea,
        he would follow his heart. He would build his dream
        car. Christian understood that it was virtually
        impossible and that many had failed before him. But
        to him, it was a mission-to create the perfect car
        with no compromises, no limits, and no fear of
        failure. <br>
        It was against this backdrop that a young Christian
        von Koenigsegg followed a dream and launched his
        own car company in 1994. To create the perfect
        Supercar. <br> </big>

            <p> 22-year old Christian von Koenigsegg
                starts Koenigsegg Automotive on
                August 12, 1994. A classic David
                versus Goliath narrative takes shape.
                It begins with a young man who had
                no track record of car manufacturing
                and little funding. But he was armed
                with a deep passion for ultimate
                performance and a dream to build the
                world's greatest sports car. <br> <br>

                After nearly two years in the making,
                Koenigsegg's concept vehicle,
                was finally driven in public for the first
                time by Rickard Rydell at an event at
                Anderstorp race track in 1996. Other
                race-car drivers to test the prototype
                included Picko Troberg and Calle
                Rosenblad. The concept worked
                spectacularly, and was a great start to
                introducing Koenigsegg to
                prospective buyers.

            <p> The Gripen Atelier consists of 11,000
                m2 of development, design,
                production, office, and showroom
                space dedicated to the Gemera lineup
                and future models, bringing the total
                footprint of Koenigsegg facilities to
                30,000 m2. It also represents a
                historic day for Swedish Automotive,
                being the first new factory to be built
                in the area in 50 years. <br> <br>
                In celebration of the CC8S's 20th
                anniversary, the Koenigsegg CC850
                was revealed at The Quail. The CC850
                is a contemporary reimagining of the
                CC8S, visually showcasing nods to
                the first Koenigseggs and the first
                model to include the Engage Shift
                System and Get 2 Chronocluster. The
                CC850 is a dual tribute to 20 years of
                vehicle production as well as the 50th
                birthday of Christian von Koenigsegg.
